# Algorithms for the TSP

Solve the given TSP instances using both a fast but approximate algorithm and a slower, yet more accurate one. Report the final cost and the number of steps.  
Instances can be found at [this link](https://github.com/squillero/computational-intelligence/tree/master/2024-25/cities).

Some techniques implemented in my proposal were discussed and developed jointly with my colleague [GDennis01](https://github.com/GDennis01/).  
In particoular we started from the same template, then we devised together a way to implement a crossover/mutation. We concluded together that the Inversion Mutation operator (explained at this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_(genetic_algorithm))) was the best choice for our scenario.
